# Predictive-Maintenance-LSTM

Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machinery using Deep Learning
A deep learning solution to forecast equipment failure and optimize maintenance schedules.
Live Application Demo: https://predictive-maintenance-lstm-abre9dtxwjbrvjf87fjhyk.streamlit.app/ ðŸš€

Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow for predictive maintenance. It utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of complex machinery based on time-series sensor data. The final, high-performance model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing for real-time health assessment.

While the model was trained on a benchmark dataset for aircraft turbofan engines, the methodology is directly applicable to any industrial equipment that generates sensor data, such as the machinery used in modern tyre manufacturing.

Business Problem : 
In capital-intensive industries like manufacturing and aviation, unexpected equipment failure is a critical issue. It leads to:

Unplanned Downtime: Halting production lines and causing significant financial losses.

High Repair Costs: Emergency repairs are far more expensive than scheduled maintenance.

Safety Risks: A failing machine can pose a danger to personnel.

This project solves this by creating a proactive system that forecasts failures before they happen, enabling a data-driven, cost-effective maintenance strategy.

Technical Workflow
The project followed a structured data science methodology:

Data Preprocessing & EDA: Loaded and cleaned the NASA C-MAPSS time-series dataset. Visualized sensor trends to confirm patterns of degradation over time.

Feature Engineering: Calculated the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for each engine in the training set. This crucial step created the ground-truth target variable for the regression model.

Feature Scaling: Applied Min-Max normalization to all sensor and setting features, scaling them to a range of [0, 1] for optimal model performance.

Data Sequencing: Transformed the time-series data into overlapping sequences (or "sliding windows") of 30 cycles. This provided the necessary historical context for the LSTM model to learn from trends.

Model Development: Built, trained, and optimized an LSTM neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was trained to predict the RUL based on the input sequences.

Evaluation: The final model was rigorously evaluated on an unseen test set to measure its real-world predictive accuracy.

Final Results
The final model demonstrated strong performance, proving its ability to accurately forecast the remaining life of the machinery.
